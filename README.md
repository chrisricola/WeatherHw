Weather App Homework

Used the api calls from Openweather to get the weather forcast, current weather and uv index. Html is constructed with bootstrap, one row with two colums. CSS gives the 5 day weather box featues the style and design. 

In the search input, the user types in the city and it runs first thru the ajax call  with parameters from the api of current weather. Then with the response I pull the current temperature, humidty and wind speed. Then I givce the elements in HTML an attribute and append the information. With the uv index, I ran a second ajax call within the frist ajax because of the city searched but with different parameters pulling the response for longitude and latitude equaling the uv index in the string. Append information as well. And the third ajax call is for the 5 day forcast. Use a different ajax call but still under the function of the current weather call. Created elemenets, set attributes to them and appended the info into 5 boxes with different days of the week. From the list of the conosle log response, i choose ever 8th call from the list. 

Screen shots of the example.
